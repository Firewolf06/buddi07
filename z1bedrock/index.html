<h1>UNOFFICIAL Z1Craft server for Bedrock Edition</h1>
<hr>
<p>IP: z1bedrock.buddi07.cf. The "Port" field should already be filled in. If not, it's 19132</p>
<p>NOTICE: This server is NOT run by Z1 or his mod team, so any problems should be directed to me on discord.</p>
<p>The server should be up most of the time, it might go down sometimes though.</p>

<p>P.S. Sorry about the site straight out of the 90s. I'm good at coding, but not CSS or design :)</p>
